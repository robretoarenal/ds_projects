For nearly seven months, through the regular season and the early rounds of the playoffs, the Houston Astros featured the best offense in baseball. It was the highest-scoring, best-balanced, most unsolvable attack in the majors.

The Astros hit for power. They hit for average. They walked the fine line between discipline and aggression: They were the best two-strike hitting team in the big leagues. In an era when so much of the battle is decided by the team that wins the strike zone, the Astros' batsmen generally won the strike zone.
