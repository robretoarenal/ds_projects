There will still be a Facebook, and an Instagram and all the familiar platforms, as this is simply a renaming of the parent company alone.

The new name also invites people to participate on its "next chapter" - a 3D journey into the metaverse, which it sees as the future of the internet.

But some analysts wonder if the public will trust the firm enough to take part in Mark Zuckerberg's new vision.

The new name produced millions of online searches for the specific query Meta in the UK and US combined, analysts say.

Dive into the Oxford English Dictionary and various definitions of meta are available - as a prefix it "denotes change, transformation, permutation, or substitution", or "beyond, above, at a higher level".

The company says it favours "beyond", but it is also seeking a metamorphosis of sorts.

A chance perhaps too to welcome a new brand untainted by leaks and negative press, though an analyst with Forrester noted "a name change doesn't suddenly erase the systemic issues plaguing the company".

Officially though it's about the future.

"Our new company brand captures where our company is going and the future we want to help build," Meta said.

That destination is the metaverse.
