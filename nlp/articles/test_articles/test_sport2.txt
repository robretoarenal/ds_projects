Tennessee Titans running back Derrick Henry suffered a potentially season-ending foot injury during Sunday's 34-31 win over the Indianapolis Colts, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.

Henry is undergoing an MRI on Monday to determine the full extent of the damage, sources told Schefter.

The Titans are concerned that Henry has a Jones fracture, which would require season-ending surgery, according to a source.

Titans coach Mike Vrabel is scheduled to talk to reporters later Monday afternoon.

The NFL's leading rusher with 937 yards, Henry has 353 more yards than any other player in the league. He also has a league-high 10 rushing touchdowns.

On Sunday, Henry rushed 28 times for 68 yards and a 2.4-yard average that was his lowest this season, playing 54 of the 73 offensive snaps. He appeared to receive medical attention on his right foot toward the end of the second half but promptly returned to the field.

The 2020 AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year did not talk to reporters after the game.

Henry, 27, led the league last year with 378 carries for 2,027 yards and 17 touchdowns.

Last week the Titans placed backup running back Darrynton Evans on IR, losing him for the season to a knee injury.

The Titans also have running backs Jeremy McNichols and Dontrell Hilliard on the roster.

Adrian Peterson, 36, the league's fifth all-time leading rusher, is traveling to Nashville to meet with Titans and to potentially help fill Henry's void, a source told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler.

The Titans (6-2) currently have the best record in the AFC after winning four straight.
